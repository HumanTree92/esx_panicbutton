This is a Police Panic Button for ESX. By default if your Police & you press Key F10 it will give you the Name, Street, & Cross Street of the Officer who pressed their Panic Button.

#### Installation

1) Add `start esx_panicbutton` to your server.cfg

2) Download & place the `esx_panicbutton` in your ESX Directory
esx_panicbutton - Panic Button for ESX

#### Releasing
I have modified this code from previous Panic Buttons. I did this to only work for ESX and to only allow Police be able to use this.
