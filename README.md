# About esx_panicbutton:
Panic Button for ESX Servers

I have modified this code from various Panic Buttons. I did this to only work for ESX and to only allow Police be able to use this.This is a Police Panic Button for ESX. By default if your Police & you press Key F10 it will give you the Name, Street, & Cross Street of the Officer who pressed their Panic Button.
